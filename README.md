#### Abstract
In this paper we describe our approach regarding an application that recognizes automatically generated tweets solely based on Twitter text. We define an autogenerated tweet (AGT) as a tweet where all or parts of the natural language content is generated automatically by a bot or other type of program.
 Our approach classifies a tweet to be either autogenerated (AGT) or human-generated (HGT) using only content of tweets. For this purpose, we use an integrated approach comprises predefined Twitter entities, natural language processing and supervised machine learning techniques.
